# CS: What's the Goalpost?

When starting a journey in computer science, it's natural to wonder: what are we actually working towards? What does success look like? In this post, we'll explore the different goalposts that define progress in CS—from academic milestones to career achievements.

## Understanding the Landscape

Computer science is a vast field with many paths. Whether you're interested in software engineering, data science, cybersecurity, or research, each path has its own set of goalposts.

### Academic Goalposts

- **Foundational Knowledge**: Understanding core concepts like algorithms, data structures, and system design
- **Specialization**: Diving deep into a specific area that interests you
- **Projects and Portfolios**: Building real-world applications that demonstrate your skills

### Career Goalposts

- **First Internship**: Getting that initial industry experience
- **Full-time Position**: Landing your first role as a software engineer or developer
- **Career Growth**: Advancing to senior roles, leading teams, or starting your own venture

## Setting Your Own Goalposts

While there are common milestones, it's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique. What matters most is setting goalposts that align with your personal interests and values.

## Conclusion

The goalpost in CS isn't a single destination—it's a series of milestones that mark your growth and learning. The key is to keep moving forward, one goalpost at a time.
