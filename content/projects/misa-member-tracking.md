# MISA's Event Registration System

This project custom-built platform I helped develop to bring order to the chaos of managing a 550-member organization. 

As one of two Lead Developers, I worked with a team of developers, designers, and project managers to build a centralized system that streamlines everything from event check-ins to voting eligibility.

It's now used organization-wide and has successfully powered 5 major events and counting.

## The Problem

For a student organization as large as MISA (Ateneo Management Information Systems Association), simple administrative tasks were becoming a huge operational headache. 

The existing process for tracking members was scattered and manual. 

Keeping a single, up-to-date database of 550+ students was tough enough, but accurately tracking who attended which events was even harder.

This created a major problem during organizational elections. 

Figuring out which members were eligible to vote, based on their attendance and engagement, involved manually cross-referencing multiple spreadsheets. 

It was slow, inefficient, and prone to human error.

## Building It Together: A Single Source of Truth

What MISA needed was a single source of truth.

For this project, we were part of a structured team that included:

- **Project Managers** who organized our work into sprints
- **A UX Designer** who created the wireframes and overall look and feel
- **A Systems Documentation lead** who managed our repository and ensured the project's longevity

As a Lead Developer, my core responsibility was to turn the designer's vision into a fully functional reality. 

I worked closely with our UX designer to ensure that the designs were not only aesthetically pleasing but also technically feasible and user-friendly. 

My co-lead developer and I handled the coding, building out the front-end UI for event check-ins and connecting it to the backend database that stored all the member data.

The entire process was a fantastic experience in communication and teamwork, ensuring that the design, development, and project goals were always in sync.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Member Database** - Single source of truth for all 550+ members
- **Event Check-in System** - Fast, digital check-ins using a tablet-friendly interface
- **Real-time Updates** - Instant synchronization across all devices
- **Voting Eligibility Tracking** - Automatic calculation of voting eligibility based on attendance
- **Event History** - Complete record of member engagement across all events

## The Solution and Its Impact

The system we built provides a simple, centralized solution. 

Instead of messy sheets scattered throughout the organization, we now have a master database that holds all member information.

We then built a clean front-end interface that Operations Managers can use on a laptop or tablet at the entrance of any event. 

When a member checks in, the manager finds their name and, with a single click, marks them as attended. 

This instantly updates the master sheet, placing a checkmark next to their name for that specific event.
